# Dario Dias - Personal Website

Hey, this is my own little portfolio/website that I am messing around with.  
I made this with **React.js** and **Vite.js**.  
I'm hosting it through **GitHub Pages** with my own domain.  

It's been pretty fun relearning and testing new UI and frontend mechanics, and I hope to expand on this further.  

I'm going to be updating it as I learn more cool things, but this is just the start!
